Unicorn developers:

We would like to thank following folks for helping make Unicorn possible:

* Ezra Zygmuntowicz - for helping Eric decide on a sane configuration
  format and reasonable defaults.
* Christian Neukirchen - for Rack, which let us put more focus on the server
  and drastically cut down on the amount of code we have to maintain.
* Zed A. Shaw - for Mongrel, without which Unicorn would not be possible

The original Mongrel contributors:

* Luis Lavena
* Wilson Bilkovich
* Why the Lucky Stiff
* Dan Kubb
* MenTaLguY
* Filipe Lautert
* Rick Olson
* Wayne E. Seguin
* Kirk Haines
* Bradley Taylor
