# processes which in turn handle the I/O and application process.
# Listener sockets are started in the master process and shared with
# forked worker children.

# Users do not need to know the internals of this class, but reading the
# {source}[https://bogomips.org/unicorn.git/tree/lib/unicorn/http_server.rb]
# is education for programmers wishing to learn how unicorn works.
