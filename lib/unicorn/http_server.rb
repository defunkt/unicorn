  # it to wake up the master from IO.select in exactly the same manner
  # djb describes in http://cr.yp.to/docs/selfpipe.html
  #
  # * The workers immediately close the pipe they inherit from the
  # master and replace it with a new pipe after forking.  This new
  # pipe is also used to wakeup from IO.select from inside (worker)
  # signal handlers.  However, workers *close* the pipe descriptors in
  # the signal handlers to raise EBADF in IO.select instead of writing
  # like we do in the master.  We cannot easily use the reader set for
  # IO.select because LISTENERS is already that set, and it's extra
  # work (and cycles) to distinguish the pipe FD from the reader set
  # once IO.select returns.  So we're lazy and just close the pipe when
  # a (rare) signal arrives in the worker and reinitialize the pipe later.
