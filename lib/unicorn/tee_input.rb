# acts like tee(1) on an input input to provide a input-like stream
# while providing rewindable semantics through a File/StringIO backing
# store.  On the first pass, the input is only read on demand so your
# Rack application can use input notification (upload progress and
# like).  This should fully conform to the Rack::Lint::InputWrapper
# specification on the public API.  This class is intended to be a
# strict interpretation of Rack::Lint::InputWrapper functionality and
# will not support any deviations from it.

# When processing uploads, Unicorn exposes a TeeInput object under
# "rack.input" of the Rack environment.
